          <strong> Project Title:</strong> Verification of Web Service Composition Using SPIN.
          <br><strong>Tools used in the project:</strong> Active TCL, Cygwin, Graphviz-2.34, GsView.
          <br><strong>Project Description:</strong> In web service there are huge business transaction
          occurs and sometimes it needs to deal with faults that can arise in any stage of transaction, while roll back mechanism is not possible. In order to achieve a common business goal, the protocol of interaction must be correct. In our project we have established a Buyer-Broker model and encode this overall model into PROMELA (Model checking Language). If any oversight happened then a compensation mechanism has been used to handle the situation. We have used linear temporal logic for verifying the model accuracy
          <br><strong>Contribution:</strong> Basically, I have codded for implementing the compensation mechanism part and also tested the overall model by using temporal logic.
